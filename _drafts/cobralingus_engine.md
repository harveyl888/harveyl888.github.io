Cobralingus is an experimental book written by Jeff Noon.  It enacts the Cobralingus Engine which uses the Noon's Metamorphiction process, working with words and language as a DJ mixes dance music.  The engine consists of a number of filter gates, each applies a particular function to the input text, generating a new output text.  In effect, the author splices, mixes and moulds words and language into something new.

I put something similar together with the pipelineR code so that my kids could play with language.
