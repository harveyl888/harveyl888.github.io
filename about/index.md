## A little about me...  

I'm originally from England, now living in the U.S.  My passions are science and technology and the blurry interface between them.  

I'm currenty working as an analytical chemist at Sanofi, a pharmaceutical company.  The work I do focuses on metabolomics/lipidomics - the study of small molecules and lipids involved in cellular processes.  Some time is spent in the lab but most is spent on data science and developing new methods to analyze data and automate the processing.

Although I've always worked in the sciences, I've been programming for about 35 years and have experience in more than 20 languages and most operating systems, including several of the extinct ones!
