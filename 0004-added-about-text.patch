+So why write a blog and why write it now?  
+I'm not a writer.  I won't even pretend to be a writer.  That's something reserved for my wife (she *is* actually a professional writer).  I do, however, spend quite a bit of time writing code and it's now time to articulate some thoughts and share code.  I'm also getting to the point where I find myself going through the same thought process to solve a problem and, in the spirit of DRY programming, I'd like to keep a record so that I can save some time.  Quite frankly it's a selfish thing I'm doing here but feel free to join the ride.

-# About me...  
+## A little about me...  
+
+I'm originally from England, now living in the U.S.  My passions are science and technology and the blurry interface between them.  
+
+I'm currenty working as an analytical chemist at Sanofi, a pharmaceutical company.  The work I do focuses on metabolomics/lipidomics - the study of small molecules and lipids involved in cellular processes.  Some time is spent in the lab but most is spent on data science and developing new methods to analyze data and automate the processing.
+
+Although I've always worked in the sciences, I've been programming for about 35 years and have experience in more than 20 languages and most operating systems, including a lot of the extinct ones!
