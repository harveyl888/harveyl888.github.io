queryBuilder is an htmlwidget wrapper for [jQuery queryBuilder](http://querybuilder.js.org/), a fantastic jQuery plugin to create queries and filters.  The widget uses dplyr to filter a data frame and extends the functionality of the original javascript library, allowing comparison between groups.
Further details can be found at this [blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/blog/2017-04-06-queryBuilder.md %}) and the code can be found at [queryBuilder](https://github.com/harveyl888/queryBuilder)
