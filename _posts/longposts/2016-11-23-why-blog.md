So why write a blog and why write it now?  
I'm not a writer.  I won't even pretend to be a writer.  That's something reserved for my wife (she *is* actually a professional writer).  I do, however, spend quite a bit of time writing code and it's now time to articulate some thoughts and share code.  I'm also getting to the point where I find myself going through the same thought process to solve a problem and, in the spirit of DRY programming, I'd like to keep a record so that I can save some time.  Quite frankly it's a selfish thing I'm doing here but feel free to join the ride.
